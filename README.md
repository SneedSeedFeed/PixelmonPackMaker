# Pixelmon Pack Maker
Crappy code that builds pixelmon resource and data packs out of some horrific hard coded sound directories and a passed in pixelmon.jar

## Todo list
- Have a better mechanism for pokemon my dumb ass brain thought had unique cries that do not
- Subtitles
- Better error handling and logging
- Maybe switch over the sound source to being entirely from my assembled sounds instead of just the ones I pulled out of Pixelmon EX
- A lot of cleaning up lol
